## 2026-06-02 — Per-paycheck full tax figure + Bills cashflow includes tips

**Goal:** Two related paycheck issues.
(1) The per-paycheck card's "Taxes" line only showed income tax (federal + state + local), omitting FICA (Social Security + Medicare). This made it disagree with the YTD "Taxes & Deductions" card (computed as gross − net, which includes FICA), and the card's own lines didn't reconcile to net. The user wants each paycheck to show the full tax amount so they know how much to set aside.
(2) The Bills cashflow calendar summed only `netAmount` for paychecks, excluding tips (`gratuityAmount`), so it understated the deposited income. It should show net income = take-home + tips, matching the auto-created income transaction.

**Changes:**
- `lib/calculations.ts` — Added `calcPaycheckTotalTax(grossAmount, netAmount, k401, hsa)` returning `max(0, gross − net − k401 − hsa)`. This back-derives the full tax (income + FICA) since the stored `PaycheckEntry` doesn't persist FICA separately. Keeps the card balanced: wages − totalTax − (401k+HSA) + tips = take-home, and matches the YTD gross − net basis.
- `app/(app)/paychecks/page.tsx`:
  - Swapped the `calcPaycheckEffectiveRate` import for `calcPaycheckTotalTax`.
  - Per-paycheck card "Taxes" line now shows `calcPaycheckTotalTax(...)` (full income + FICA) instead of `federalWithheld + stateWithheld + localWithheld`.
  - The effective-rate label now derives from the full tax (`totalTax / gross`) so it stays consistent with the new Taxes figure.
- `app/(app)/bills/page.tsx` — In `CashflowCalendar`, all three paycheck displays now add `+ (p.gratuityAmount ?? 0)`: the header `totalPaychecksAmt` sum, the per-day tooltip, and the footer summary badges.
- `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts` — Added a `calcPaycheckTotalTax` describe block (full-tax back-derivation incl. the user's 819.93/708.60 → 111.33 case, exclusion of 401k/HSA, and non-negative clamp).

**Notes:**
- `calcPaycheckEffectiveRate` is kept (still has its own tests) but is no longer used by the page; the card now reports the full effective tax rate.
- Edge case: if a user has IRA contributions (`iraAnnual`), `gross − net − k401 − hsa` folds IRA into the "Taxes" figure since IRA isn't stored or shown anywhere on the card. This keeps the card arithmetic exact and matches the YTD basis; IRA is typically 0.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), `npm test` 293/293 passing.

## 2026-06-01 — Restart Transactions income/spending/net totals monthly

**Goal:** The INCOME / SPENDING / NET summary cards on the Transactions (Spending) page summed *every* transaction ever, so the numbers grew without bound and "this month vs last month" was impossible to read. Scope the totals (and the ledger below) to one month at a time, defaulting to the current month, with a month switcher so prior months stay reachable.

**Changes:**
- `app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx`:
  - Added month-scoping helpers near the other module-level helpers: `currentMonth()` (returns `today().slice(0,7)`), `shiftMonth(ym, delta)` (adds/subtracts months on a `YYYY-MM` string), and `formatMonthLabel(ym)` (→ e.g. "June 2026", `en-US` to match `formatDate`).
  - Added `selectedMonth` state (`string | null`), defaulting to `currentMonth()`. `null` = all-time view.
  - Extended the `filtered` memo with `matchMonth` (`tx.date.slice(0,7) === selectedMonth`, bypassed when `null`); added `selectedMonth` to its deps. Both the summary totals and the rendered list derive from `filtered`, so both now respect the selected month.
  - Added `selectedMonth` to `filterKey` so the paging counter resets when the month changes.
  - Added a month navigator above the summary cards: a pill with ◀ / month label / ▶ chevrons (`ChevronLeft` newly imported), plus an "All time" toggle button. Next-month chevron is disabled at the current month (no future data); chevrons are disabled/dimmed in all-time mode.
- `locales/en.json` & `locales/vi.json` — Added `transactions.allTime`, `transactions.prevMonth`, `transactions.nextMonth`.

**Notes:**
- Scoped *both* the cards and the ledger to the selected month (rather than cards-only) so the view is internally consistent — picking a month shows that month's numbers and that month's transactions. Search/type/category filters now operate within the selected month.
- Export CSV exports `filtered`, so it now exports the visible month's rows (consistent with what's on screen). All-time export is still available via the "All time" toggle.
- On the 1st of a month the current month may be near-empty — this is the intended "restart" behavior; tap ◀ to view the prior month.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (only pre-existing warnings elsewhere), `npm test` 290/290 passing.

## 2026-05-29 — Keep dashboard card action buttons on one line

**Goal:** The "View All" button in the Bill Forecast card was wrapping onto two lines in narrow layouts. Make all dashboard card header action buttons render their text cleanly on a single row.

**Changes:**
- `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — Added `whitespace-nowrap` to the four `CardHeader` action links so their labels never wrap:
  - Budget card "Manage" (indigo) link → `/planning`.
  - Savings Goals card "Manage" (purple) link → `/planning`.
  - Bill Forecast card "View All" (amber) link → `/bills` (the one that was wrapping; kept existing `inline-block mt-1`).
  - Recent Transactions card "View All" (emerald) link → `/transactions`.

**Notes:**
- Pure styling change; no logic, copy, or i18n keys touched.

## 2026-05-29 — Add display name preference in Settings

**Goal:** Let users choose the name shown in the dashboard greeting, defaulting to their Google account name when left blank.

**Changes:**
- `types/index.ts` — Added `displayName: string` to the `TaxSettings` interface (empty string = fall back to Google account name).
- `lib/utils.ts` — Added `displayName: ''` to `DEFAULT_TAX_SETTINGS`.
- `lib/sheets.ts` — Persist the new field in the user's Google Sheets `Settings` tab:
  - `getSettings` now reads the `display_name` key (defaults to `''`).
  - `saveSettings` now writes the `display_name` row.
- `app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` — New "Name Preference" card at the top of the settings list:
  - Uses `useSession()` (next-auth) to read the Google account name, shown as the input placeholder.
  - Text input bound to `settings.displayName`, saved via the existing Save Settings flow.
  - "Use Google name" link clears the custom value (reverts to default) when a custom name is set.
  - Loader now backfills `displayName: s.displayName ?? ''`.
- `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — Greeting now uses `settings.displayName` (trimmed) when set, otherwise falls back to the first word of the Google account name.
- `locales/en.json` & `locales/vi.json` — Added settings keys: `namePreference`, `displayName`, `displayNameDesc`, `displayNamePlaceholder`, `useGoogleName`.
- `lib/__tests__/tax.test.ts` — Added `displayName: ''` to the `BASE_SETTINGS` fixture to satisfy the updated type.

**Notes:**
- Settings live in the user's Google Sheets (no DB), so the new field is just another key-value row.
- Custom names are shown as-is in the greeting; Google names are still trimmed to first name only (existing behavior preserved).

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors, `npm test` 290/290 passing.
