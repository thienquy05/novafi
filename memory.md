## 2026-06-02 — Roll over last month's overspend even without a frozen snapshot (branch claude/budget-rollover-carry-from-history)

**Bug (user):** All Planning budgets showed `$0.00` used with empty bars at the start of June, even though the "vs last mo" line and 3-month average proved last month had real spending — e.g. Shopping ($291.67/mo cap) spent ~$1,338 and Transportation ($150 cap) spent ~$213 last month (both **overspent**). Nothing rolled over. "the amount isn't roll over too… I will need to keep that amount over the next month if overspent and the progress bar should display with proper percentage."

**Root cause:** `rolledOverDeficit()` returned `0` whenever `budget.prevMonth !== prevMonthKey || prevCap === undefined`. The frozen-cap snapshot (shipped earlier today) is only captured at a month boundary going forward, and the **first reconcile this month already advanced these legacy budgets to `activeMonth = '2026-06'` with an empty snapshot** — so they carry nothing until *next* month. The transaction history needed to compute the overspend was available, but the gate refused to use it.

**Decision (user):** make the overspend carry in **now**, from history, using last month's cap.

**Fix — `app/(app)/planning/page.tsx`:**
- `rolledOverDeficit()` now picks `lastMonthCap = (prevMonth === prevMonthKey && prevCap !== undefined) ? prevCap : monthlyAmount(budget)` — prefer the frozen cap when present (accurate across cap edits), otherwise **fall back to the budget's current monthly cap**. So `calcRolloverDeficit(lastMonthCap, prevSpentForCategory(cat))` carries a genuine prior overspend immediately instead of waiting a full month.
- `saveBudget()` now **freezes the pre-edit cap** the first time a snapshot-less budget is edited: `hasSnapshot = base.prevMonth === prevMonthKey && base.prevCap !== undefined`; when false it sets `prevMonth = prevMonthKey`, `prevCap = monthlyAmount(base)` (the OLD amount). Without this, the current-cap fallback would let lowering a cap retroactively turn last month's under-cap spend into a fabricated deficit (the d5ae700 bug). Freezing the old cap keeps the carried overspend measured against the real prior cap; changing this month's amount only moves the bar's denominator. The server's `upsertBudget` then persists the snapshot.

**Behavior note:** because the fallback uses transaction history, a budget whose category was overspent last month carries that overspend in even if it lacks a snapshot — including, by design, a newly added budget on a previously-overspent category. Surplus/underspend never carries (deficit-only). Requires the **Budget Rollover** setting to be ON.

**Tests:** pure-function suite unchanged (the cap-selection logic lives in the component); `calcRolloverDeficit`/`calcEffectiveSpent` still green. Verified `tsc --noEmit` clean, eslint 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), 306 tests pass.

## 2026-06-02 — Stop budget edits from making the rollover bar jump/fill (branch claude/budget-rollover-progress-bar-V50Ng)

**Bug (user):** "When I change the budget amount, the progress bar goes full and it brings last month's number, subtracting it from the new budget I just set." Carry-in rollover (frozen `prevCap`, shipped earlier today) was correct in the math, but **editing the amount** still misbehaved in the UI.

**Root cause:** `saveBudget` in `app/(app)/planning/page.tsx` rebuilt the optimistic `Budget` object from the form only — `{ id, category, amount, period }` — **dropping** `position`/`activeMonth`/`prevMonth`/`prevCap`. So immediately after an edit the local row had no snapshot → `rolledOverDeficit()` returned 0 and the bar briefly shrank; then the next `/api/budgets` load returned the server-preserved snapshot and the bar **jumped back** to include the carried-over deficit (looking like the edit "filled" it). The deficit denominator is the new `amount`, so a lowered cap made the jump land at/over 100%.

**Decision (user):** keep the **carry-in / fill-the-bar** behavior (a genuine prior overspend should eat into this month's bar) — only kill the edit-time jump.

**Fix — `app/(app)/planning/page.tsx` `saveBudget`:** carry the existing row's snapshot through the edit. `const base = editBudget ?? sameCategory;` then the new budget includes `position/activeMonth/prevMonth/prevCap` from `base`. Now the optimistic state matches what the server stores, so the bar is stable across an edit. Because `prevCap` is the **frozen** last-month cap (untouched by the edit), changing this month's `amount` only moves the bar's denominator — it can never fabricate or resurrect a deficit. (Server `upsertBudget` already preserved these fields; this aligns the optimistic UI with it.)

**Tests:** existing `calcRolloverDeficit(500, 499.36) === 0` frozen-cap regression in `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts` still covers the "edit can't invent a deficit" math. Verified `tsc --noEmit` clean, eslint 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), 306 tests pass.

## 2026-06-02 — Make budget rollover accurate via a frozen monthly-cap snapshot (branch claude/budget-calculation-bug-INfrq)

**Bug:** After lowering a budget (e.g. Insurance $500 → $110), the Planning card showed the spent amount and progress bar inflated by a phantom "+$X from last month" deficit, turning the bar full and red ("$279.36 over") even though nothing was spent this month. The Dashboard and reports correctly showed the category as **not** over budget, so the views disagreed.

**Root cause:** the opt-in rollover (Planning only) computed `rolledOverDeficit = max(0, prevMonthSpend − currentBudget)` and displayed `usage = spent + rolledOverDeficit`. Because the deficit was measured against the **current** cap and `Budget` stored only a single `amount` (no per-month history), lowering the cap retroactively reinterpreted last month: $499.36 spent under the old $500 cap (not overspent) exceeded the new $110 cap → fabricated $389.36. Dashboard/`BudgetBars` use plain `spent`, hence the mismatch.

**Decision (user):** keep carrying a real prior overspend **into this month's bar** (old behavior), but make it accurate so editing the cap never invents a deficit. This requires knowing last month's *actual* cap, which wasn't stored — so we now snapshot it.

**Data model — `types/index.ts`:** `Budget` gained `activeMonth?`, `prevMonth?`, `prevCap?`. `activeMonth` (YYYY-MM) is the month the current `amount` has been the active cap for; at each month rollover the just-ended month is frozen into `prevMonth`/`prevCap` (the monthly-equivalent cap that was active then).

**Persistence — `lib/sheets.ts`:**
- Budgets now span cols A–H (was A–E). `getBudgets` reads/maps F=`activeMonth`, G=`prevMonth`, H=`prevCap`; range `A2:H200`.
- `upsertBudget` preserves the snapshot fields across edits (merges from the existing row; a brand-new budget starts `activeMonth = current month` and carries nothing until it has lived a full month). Writes all 8 cols; delete extent `H`. `deleteRowById` deletes the whole row, so extra cols are safe.
- Added `monthKey(date?)`, `monthlyEquivalent(amount, period)`, and `reconcileBudgetMonths(...)`: on the first load of a new month it freezes `prevMonth = oldActiveMonth`, `prevCap = monthlyEquivalent(amount, period)`, `activeMonth = currentMonth` via an **in-place** `F:H` batch update (no row reordering). Legacy budgets with no prior `activeMonth` carry nothing the first time (we can't know a past cap → no phantom); accurate from the next month on. Only writes when a month actually changed.
- The batch readers (`A2:D200`) for the Dashboard are untouched — they don't need snapshots.

**Route — `app/api/budgets/route.ts`:** GET now calls `reconcileBudgetMonths` after `getBudgets` (cache-miss path) and caches/returns the reconciled budgets.

**UI — `app/(app)/planning/page.tsx`:** restored the `budgetRollover`-gated rollover, but `rolledOverDeficit(budget)` now returns `0` unless `budget.prevMonth === prevMonthKey` and `budget.prevCap` is set, otherwise `calcRolloverDeficit(budget.prevCap, prevSpentForCategory(cat))` — i.e. last month's spend vs last month's **frozen** cap. `usage`/`pct`/`over`/`remaining`/`projected`/`overBudgetCount` and the "+$X from last month" badge use that accurate deficit. Net effect: lowering Insurance to $110 (under $500 last month) shows `$0 / $110`, empty bar, no badge; a genuine prior overspend still carries into the bar.

**Tests — `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts`:** added a regression asserting `calcRolloverDeficit(500, 499.36) === 0` (frozen cap) while `calcRolloverDeficit(110, 499.36) ≈ 389.36` (the old phantom).

**Note:** Dashboard still shows current-month actual spend only (separate data path, no snapshots) — intentional; Planning is the surface that reflects carry-over.

Verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean; eslint 0 errors (only the pre-existing planning setState-in-effect + sheets `_lastCol` warnings); 299 tests pass (223 in the calculations suite).

## 2026-06-02 — Loans/IOU tracker + split bills count only my share

**Goal (per user decisions):** Add a personal lend/borrow (IOU) tracker, and make the Bills section's monthly/cashflow totals reflect only the user's share of split bills.

**Loans / IOUs** — a two-way tracker in the Transactions section. Money model: lending moves cash **out of an existing account** (no new account is created) via a `transfer` transaction with an empty counterparty, so it shifts the balance but is **not** counted as spending or income (transfers are already excluded from those aggregates). Repayment moves cash back **in** the same way. Borrowing is the mirror. Supports **partial paybacks** (running remaining, auto-settles at zero). An account is optional — with none picked, the loan is a pure note with no balance effect.
- `types/index.ts` — new `Loan` interface: `{ id, direction: 'lent'|'borrowed', contactId, contactName, account, principal, repaidAmount, date, note, settled, settledDate, principalTxId, repaymentTxIds[] }`.
- `lib/sheets.ts` — `Loans` tab (`A:M`, lazily auto-created via `ensureSheet`/`isMissingTabError`) with `getLoans`/`upsertLoan`/`deleteLoan`; `repaymentTxIds` stored pipe-joined. Added `Loan` to type imports + `LOANS_HEADER`.
- `lib/auth.ts` — new spreadsheets provision a `Loans` tab + header.
- `app/api/loans/route.ts` — GET (cached `loans:<id>`, SHORT TTL), POST upsert, DELETE.
- `lib/calculations.ts` — pure `calcLoanRemaining(principal, repaidAmount)` → `max(0, round(principal − repaid))`; 6 new tests in `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts`.
- `app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx`:
  - Reuses the existing **Contacts** list (fetches `/api/contacts`, inline "+ Add new contact"); fetches `/api/loans` in `load()`.
  - Module-level `buildLoanTx(direction, kind, amount, account, desc, date)` builds the cash `transfer` (cash out when lending principal or repaying a borrow; cash in otherwise; empty counterparty); `roundCents` helper.
  - Header **"Loans"** button (with open-count badge) + a summary card (owed-to-you / you-owe) — both open the Loans modal.
  - **Loans modal** (the "container"): inline add-loan form (direction toggle, contact, amount, account, date, note), owed/you-owe totals, open loans with remaining + progress bar + inline **Record payback** form, and a settled section. `handleAddLoan`/`handleRecordPayback`/`handleDeleteLoan`/`handleAddLoanContact`. Adding/repaying with an account also posts the cash transfer and calls `load()` to refresh balances; deleting a loan reverses all its linked transfers.
- i18n: new `loans.*` block in `locales/en.json` + `locales/vi.json`.

**Split bills → my-share-only totals** (`app/(app)/bills/page.tsx`): added module-level `myBillShare(bill)` (= `calcSplitShares(amount, splitAmount).mine` for shared bills, else full amount). The **Monthly** summary card, the cashflow calendar (`totalBillsAmt` + day tooltips), and the timeline (`totalThisMonth` + titles) now use `myBillShare` so they reflect what actually leaves your account. The per-bill card still shows the full amount plus the `you X / them Y` badge. (Dashboard bill forecast still uses full amounts — possible follow-up.)

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), `npm test` 305/305 passing (299 prior + 6 new `calcLoanRemaining` tests).

## 2026-06-02 — Shared/split bills with "Owed to You" tracking

**Goal:** Let a bill be shared with another person. **Final money model (per user decision):** marking a shared bill paid records **only your own share** as the expense — the other person covers their part separately. The other person's share is tracked in a new **"Owed to You"** section with a Transferred checkbox; this tracker is **purely informational and creates no transactions**. Because the expense is already just your share, Spending / category totals / Safe-to-Spend / Reports / balances are all correct immediately, with no offsetting/refund entries. Contacts are reusable but kept minimal.

(Note: this shipped in two commits — the first implemented a "front the full amount, then post an offsetting refund when they pay you back" model; the second simplified to the "expense = my share, informational tracker" model described here. This entry reflects the final shipped behavior.)

**Data model:**
- `types/index.ts`:
  - `Bill` gained `splitContactId?: string` and `splitAmount?: number` (the other person's share of `amount`; your share = `amount - splitAmount`).
  - New `Contact` interface `{ id, name, createdAt }` — reusable people you split with.
  - New `Split` interface — one "owed to you" record created per split-bill payment: `{ id, billId, billName, contactId, contactName, amount, category, account, date, settled, settledDate }`. `billName`/`contactName` are denormalized for display; `category`/`account`/`date` capture how the bill was paid (context only); `settled`/`settledDate` track whether they've paid you. No transaction is linked — settling is informational.

**Persistence (`lib/sheets.ts`):**
- Added a generic `ensureSheet(sheets, spreadsheetId, title, header)` helper that lazily creates a tab + header row on demand (so spreadsheets provisioned before this feature get `Contacts`/`Splits` without a migration — mirrors the existing NetWorthHistory pattern).
- Added `isMissingTabError(err)` — the lazy-create `catch` for `getContacts`/`getSplits` now only swallows a missing-tab error (HTTP 400 / "Unable to parse range") and rethrows real failures (network/auth/5xx) instead of masking them as empty.
- Bills now persist split columns I/J. Extracted a shared `rowToBill` parser (legacy 8-col rows simply parse as unsplit). `getBills`, `upsertBill`, and both batch readers (`batchGetBadgesData`, `batchGetDashboardData`) use the wider `Bills!A2:J200` range / shared parser. `upsertBill`/`deleteBill` last-col bumped to `J`.
- New `Contacts` tab (`A:C`) CRUD: `getContacts`/`upsertContact`/`deleteContact` (lazy-ensure on read/write).
- New `Splits` tab (`A:K`) CRUD: `getSplits`/`upsertSplit`/`deleteSplit` (lazy-ensure). `settled` stored as `'true'/'false'`.
- Added `Contact`/`Split` to the type imports.

**Spreadsheet bootstrap (`lib/auth.ts`):** New spreadsheets now create `Contacts` and `Splits` tabs and seed their headers; Bills header extended with `split_contact_id`, `split_amount`.

**APIs:**
- New `app/api/contacts/route.ts` (GET cached `contacts:<id>` LONG TTL, POST upsert, DELETE) and `app/api/splits/route.ts` (GET cached `splits:<id>` SHORT TTL, POST upsert, DELETE) — modeled on the existing bills/goals routes.

**Calculations (`lib/calculations.ts`):** Added pure `calcSplitShares(total, theirShare)` → `{ mine, theirs }`, clamping `theirShare` to `[0, total]` and rounding to cents. Used for the modal preview, the bill-card badge, and to default the Record Payment amount to your share. Covered by 6 new tests in `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts`.

**Bills UI (`app/(app)/bills/page.tsx`):**
- `load()` now also fetches `/api/contacts` and `/api/splits`; added `contacts`/`splits` state plus inline new-contact state and `settlingSplitId`.
- Add/Edit bill modal: new "Split this bill" section — checkbox to enable, contact picker (with an inline "+ Add new contact" option that creates a reusable `Contact` via `handleAddContact`), a "Their share ($)" input, and a live your-share/their-share breakdown via `calcSplitShares` (shown whenever the bill amount > 0, so it never blanks out while editing).
- Active bill cards show a split badge (`{name} · you X / them Y`) when the bill is shared.
- Record Payment: for a shared bill the amount **defaults to your share** (`calcSplitShares(...).mine`); recording posts that expense, advances the due date, and — only after the expense write is confirmed `ok` — creates a pending `Split` ("owed to you") record (avoids an orphaned record if the expense fails).
- New "Owed to You" section: per-contact pending totals, and a row per split with a **Transferred checkbox** (`handleSplitToggle`). Toggling only flips `settled`/`settledDate` and writes the split — **no transaction is created**. A trash button (`handleDeleteSplit`) removes a record.
- Everything routes through the existing transactions plumbing, so account balances, dashboard Safe-to-Spend, Spending, and Reports stay consistent.

**i18n:** Added ~24 `bills.*` keys to `locales/en.json` and `locales/vi.json` (split section, owed-to-you section, transferred states, toasts).

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (only pre-existing warnings), `npm test` 296/296 passing (290 prior + 6 new `calcSplitShares` tests). Dependencies were installed in the container (`npm ci`) so the checks could run.

## 2026-06-02 — Per-paycheck full tax figure + Bills cashflow includes tips

**Goal:** Two related paycheck issues.
(1) The per-paycheck card's "Taxes" line only showed income tax (federal + state + local), omitting FICA (Social Security + Medicare). This made it disagree with the YTD "Taxes & Deductions" card (computed as gross − net, which includes FICA), and the card's own lines didn't reconcile to net. The user wants each paycheck to show the full tax amount so they know how much to set aside.
(2) The Bills cashflow calendar summed only `netAmount` for paychecks, excluding tips (`gratuityAmount`), so it understated the deposited income. It should show net income = take-home + tips, matching the auto-created income transaction.

**Changes:**
- `lib/calculations.ts` — Added `calcPaycheckTotalTax(grossAmount, netAmount, k401, hsa)` returning `max(0, gross − net − k401 − hsa)`. This back-derives the full tax (income + FICA) since the stored `PaycheckEntry` doesn't persist FICA separately. Keeps the card balanced: wages − totalTax − (401k+HSA) + tips = take-home, and matches the YTD gross − net basis.
- `app/(app)/paychecks/page.tsx`:
  - Swapped the `calcPaycheckEffectiveRate` import for `calcPaycheckTotalTax`.
  - Per-paycheck card "Taxes" line now shows `calcPaycheckTotalTax(...)` (full income + FICA) instead of `federalWithheld + stateWithheld + localWithheld`.
  - The effective-rate label now derives from the full tax (`totalTax / gross`) so it stays consistent with the new Taxes figure.
- `app/(app)/bills/page.tsx` — In `CashflowCalendar`, all three paycheck displays now add `+ (p.gratuityAmount ?? 0)`: the header `totalPaychecksAmt` sum, the per-day tooltip, and the footer summary badges.
- `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts` — Added a `calcPaycheckTotalTax` describe block (full-tax back-derivation incl. the user's 819.93/708.60 → 111.33 case, exclusion of 401k/HSA, and non-negative clamp).

**Notes:**
- `calcPaycheckEffectiveRate` is kept (still has its own tests) but is no longer used by the page; the card now reports the full effective tax rate.
- Edge case: if a user has IRA contributions (`iraAnnual`), `gross − net − k401 − hsa` folds IRA into the "Taxes" figure since IRA isn't stored or shown anywhere on the card. This keeps the card arithmetic exact and matches the YTD basis; IRA is typically 0.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), `npm test` 293/293 passing.

## 2026-06-01 — Restart Transactions income/spending/net totals monthly

**Goal:** The INCOME / SPENDING / NET summary cards on the Transactions (Spending) page summed *every* transaction ever, so the numbers grew without bound and "this month vs last month" was impossible to read. Scope the totals (and the ledger below) to one month at a time, defaulting to the current month, with a month switcher so prior months stay reachable.

**Changes:**
- `app/(app)/transactions/page.tsx`:
  - Added month-scoping helpers near the other module-level helpers: `currentMonth()` (returns `today().slice(0,7)`), `shiftMonth(ym, delta)` (adds/subtracts months on a `YYYY-MM` string), and `formatMonthLabel(ym)` (→ e.g. "June 2026", `en-US` to match `formatDate`).
  - Added `selectedMonth` state (`string | null`), defaulting to `currentMonth()`. `null` = all-time view.
  - Extended the `filtered` memo with `matchMonth` (`tx.date.slice(0,7) === selectedMonth`, bypassed when `null`); added `selectedMonth` to its deps. Both the summary totals and the rendered list derive from `filtered`, so both now respect the selected month.
  - Added `selectedMonth` to `filterKey` so the paging counter resets when the month changes.
  - Added a month navigator above the summary cards: a pill with ◀ / month label / ▶ chevrons (`ChevronLeft` newly imported), plus an "All time" toggle button. Next-month chevron is disabled at the current month (no future data); chevrons are disabled/dimmed in all-time mode.
- `locales/en.json` & `locales/vi.json` — Added `transactions.allTime`, `transactions.prevMonth`, `transactions.nextMonth`.

**Notes:**
- Scoped *both* the cards and the ledger to the selected month (rather than cards-only) so the view is internally consistent — picking a month shows that month's numbers and that month's transactions. Search/type/category filters now operate within the selected month.
- Export CSV exports `filtered`, so it now exports the visible month's rows (consistent with what's on screen). All-time export is still available via the "All time" toggle.
- On the 1st of a month the current month may be near-empty — this is the intended "restart" behavior; tap ◀ to view the prior month.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors (only pre-existing warnings elsewhere), `npm test` 290/290 passing.

## 2026-05-29 — Keep dashboard card action buttons on one line

**Goal:** The "View All" button in the Bill Forecast card was wrapping onto two lines in narrow layouts. Make all dashboard card header action buttons render their text cleanly on a single row.

**Changes:**
- `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — Added `whitespace-nowrap` to the four `CardHeader` action links so their labels never wrap:
  - Budget card "Manage" (indigo) link → `/planning`.
  - Savings Goals card "Manage" (purple) link → `/planning`.
  - Bill Forecast card "View All" (amber) link → `/bills` (the one that was wrapping; kept existing `inline-block mt-1`).
  - Recent Transactions card "View All" (emerald) link → `/transactions`.

**Notes:**
- Pure styling change; no logic, copy, or i18n keys touched.

## 2026-05-29 — Add display name preference in Settings

**Goal:** Let users choose the name shown in the dashboard greeting, defaulting to their Google account name when left blank.

**Changes:**
- `types/index.ts` — Added `displayName: string` to the `TaxSettings` interface (empty string = fall back to Google account name).
- `lib/utils.ts` — Added `displayName: ''` to `DEFAULT_TAX_SETTINGS`.
- `lib/sheets.ts` — Persist the new field in the user's Google Sheets `Settings` tab:
  - `getSettings` now reads the `display_name` key (defaults to `''`).
  - `saveSettings` now writes the `display_name` row.
- `app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` — New "Name Preference" card at the top of the settings list:
  - Uses `useSession()` (next-auth) to read the Google account name, shown as the input placeholder.
  - Text input bound to `settings.displayName`, saved via the existing Save Settings flow.
  - "Use Google name" link clears the custom value (reverts to default) when a custom name is set.
  - Loader now backfills `displayName: s.displayName ?? ''`.
- `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — Greeting now uses `settings.displayName` (trimmed) when set, otherwise falls back to the first word of the Google account name.
- `locales/en.json` & `locales/vi.json` — Added settings keys: `namePreference`, `displayName`, `displayNameDesc`, `displayNamePlaceholder`, `useGoogleName`.
- `lib/__tests__/tax.test.ts` — Added `displayName: ''` to the `BASE_SETTINGS` fixture to satisfy the updated type.

**Notes:**
- Settings live in the user's Google Sheets (no DB), so the new field is just another key-value row.
- Custom names are shown as-is in the greeting; Google names are still trimmed to first name only (existing behavior preserved).

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` 0 errors, `npm test` 290/290 passing.

## 2026-06-02 — Paycheck: keep full amount as real money, only calculate tax to set aside

**Goal:** Switch paychecks from a withholding model (deposit net take-home, taxes disappear) to a full-deposit model: the entire amount received is deposited as real money, and the app just calculates the tax to set aside (save). Per the user's choice, "tax to set aside" = all taxes (federal + state + city + FICA); 401k/HSA are NOT subtracted; the deposited amount is the full amount received (wages + tips).

**Changes:**
- `types/index.ts` — `PaycheckEntry`: added `ficaWithheld: number` (FICA to set aside, now persisted) and rewrote field comments for the full-deposit model. In this model `netAmount` = wages kept (= `grossAmount`) and `k401`/`hsa` are 0 (nothing auto-deducted); the federal/state/local/FICA fields are amounts to SAVE, not withheld.
- `lib/sheets.ts` — Persist FICA in a new Google Sheets column **L** for the `Paychecks` tab:
  - `getPaychecks` range `A2:K` → `A2:L`; `rowToPaycheck` reads `ficaWithheld: Number(r[11] ?? 0)`.
  - `addPaycheck` appends `entry.ficaWithheld ?? 0` as the 12th value.
  - `deletePaycheck` last column `'K'` → `'L'`.
  - Dashboard batchGet: `Paychecks!A2:K` → `A2:L` and its inline paycheck parser now reads `ficaWithheld` from `r[11]`.
- `lib/calculations.ts` — Replaced `calcPaycheckTotalTax(gross, net, k401, hsa)` with `calcPaycheckTaxToSave(entry)`: sums the explicit `federalWithheld + stateWithheld + localWithheld + ficaWithheld`, with a legacy fallback (`gross − net − k401 − hsa`) for old entries that predate the model / lack stored FICA. Returns `roundCents(max(explicit, legacy))`.
- `app/(app)/paychecks/page.tsx`:
  - `handleSave` now stores `ficaWithheld = preview.ficaSs + preview.ficaMedicare`, `k401 = 0`, `hsa = 0`, `netAmount = preview.grossPaycheck`. The auto-created income transaction deposits the **full amount** = `preview.grossPaycheck + gratuity` (was `preview.netPaycheck + gratuity`).
  - YTD cards: replaced "YTD Net"/"YTD Taxes & Deductions" with "YTD Deposited (real money)" (= gross + tips) and "YTD Tax to Set Aside" (= Σ `calcPaycheckTaxToSave`).
  - Per-paycheck row: "Taxes" column → "Set aside" (positive amount, no minus since it's earmarked, not removed); 401k+HSA column now only shows when > 0; deposit label → "Deposited"; effective-rate line uses `calcPaycheckTaxToSave / gross`.
  - Live preview: dropped the 401k/HSA deduction lines; taxes shown as positive "set aside" amounts under a "Set aside for taxes" hint; bottom line shows "Real money deposited" (= gross + tips) and "Tax to set aside" (= `preview.totalTax`).
  - Swapped import `calcPaycheckTotalTax` → `calcPaycheckTaxToSave`.
- `app/(app)/bills/page.tsx` — Updated the cash-flow comment to "Real money deposited" (the `netAmount + gratuity` math is unchanged and still correct since `netAmount` now equals gross).
- `locales/en.json` & `locales/vi.json` — paychecks keys: new `ytdDeposited`, `ytdTaxToSave`, `taxToSetAsideHint`, `realMoneyDeposited`, `taxToSetAside`, `setAside`, `deposited`; removed now-unused `ytdNet`, `ytdTaxes`, `netOfTaxable`, `netTakeHome`, `totalTakeHome`; updated `subtitle` and `effectiveTaxRate` copy.
- `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts` — Replaced the `calcPaycheckTotalTax` describe block with `calcPaycheckTaxToSave` tests (explicit-sum full-deposit entry, legacy back-derivation, never-negative).

**Notes:**
- Backward compatibility: legacy paychecks (logged under the old net-deposit model, no stored FICA) still display their full tax via the legacy fallback in `calcPaycheckTaxToSave`, and their deposit display (`netAmount + gratuity`) reflects what was actually posted.
- The 2026 tax engine (`lib/tax.ts`) is unchanged; `preview.totalTax` (fed + state + city + FICA) is exactly the "tax to set aside" total.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build` succeeds, `npm run lint` 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), `npm test` 306/306 passing.

## 2026-06-02 — Paycheck: simplify YTD cards + use deposited (gross) amount everywhere

**Goal:** Follow-up to the full-deposit model. (1) Simplify the paycheck UI: collapse the four YTD cards to just two — "YTD Income (deposited)" and "YTD Tax" — and drop the verbose "real money" / "set aside" wording from the live-preview and per-paycheck card. (2) Make the deposited (full gross + tips) amount the single source of truth everywhere it's shown, so legacy entries (whose stored `netAmount` is an after-tax figure) no longer display the after-tax amount.

**Changes:**
- `lib/calculations.ts` — Added `calcPaycheckDeposited(p)` = `roundCents(grossAmount + (gratuityAmount ?? 0))`. This is now the one place that defines "what was deposited" — always the full amount, independent of how `netAmount` was stored (fixes legacy entries that recorded net < gross).
- `app/(app)/paychecks/page.tsx`:
  - YTD memo reduced to `{ ytdIncome, ytdTax }` (income via `calcPaycheckDeposited`, tax via `calcPaycheckTaxToSave`); grid is now 2 cards (`grid-cols-2`) — "YTD Income (deposited)" and "YTD Tax". Removed the Taxable Wages and Tips cards.
  - Per-paycheck "Set aside" column relabeled "Tax"; the "Deposited" figure now uses `calcPaycheckDeposited(p)` (was `netAmount + gratuity`).
  - Live preview bottom lines renamed: "Real money deposited" → "Income (deposited)" (`paychecks.income`), "Tax to set aside" → "Tax" (`paychecks.tax`); removed the "Set aside for taxes" hint line.
  - Imported `calcPaycheckDeposited`.
- `app/(app)/bills/page.tsx` — All three cash-flow paycheck sums now use `calcPaycheckDeposited(p)` instead of `netAmount + gratuity`; imported the helper.
- `locales/en.json` & `locales/vi.json` — paychecks keys: added `ytdIncome`, `ytdTax`, `income`, `tax`; removed now-unused `ytdTaxableWages`, `ytdDeposited`, `ytdTaxToSave`, `ytdTips`, `hsa`, `setAside`, `taxToSetAsideHint`, `realMoneyDeposited`, `taxToSetAside`.
- `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts` — Added a `calcPaycheckDeposited` describe block (gross + tips, missing tips → 0, full gross regardless of withheld tax).

**Notes:**
- Account balances are transaction-driven: a newly logged paycheck posts an income transaction for the full amount (`grossPaycheck + gratuity`) and the balance increments by that full amount, so the whole system already uses the deposited amount going forward. Paychecks logged under the OLD net-deposit model still have a net-valued transaction, so their historical account balance reflects net — that historical ledger data is intentionally NOT auto-migrated here (would require a fuzzy paycheck↔transaction match and mutating financial records); offered separately to the user.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build` succeeds, `npm run lint` 0 errors (pre-existing warnings only), `npm test` 309/309 passing.

## 2026-06-02 — Balance Check (reconcile): stop the debt-overpayment clamp from inflating credit-card balances (branch claude/admiring-meitner-3kc96)

**Symptom (user report):** Running the "Balance Check" / reconcile on a credit card (Capital One) proposed a much higher "after" balance (e.g. $1,212.36 → $2,166.54). It behaved as if reconciliation only summed expenses and ignored the income/paybacks.

**Root cause:** `applyTransferToBalance(balance, amount, isDebt)` clamped debt payoffs at zero with `Math.max(0, balance - amount)`, but its inverse `reverseTransferToBalance` (`balance + amount`) did NOT clamp. So `apply` and `reverse` were not true inverses — the exact invariant `deriveOpeningBalance` and `reconcileAccountBalance` rely on. When a card **payment** replays chronologically *before* the charge it covers (a backdated payment, or simply because the opening balance was set to the current owed amount while transaction history exists), the running owed balance is still low/zero at that point, so the clamp silently discards the payment while the later expenses still pile on — inflating the reconciled balance.

**Fix:**
- `lib/calculations.ts` — `applyTransferToBalance` now returns `roundCents(isDebt ? balance - amount : balance + amount)` (no zero clamp). Overpaying a card now yields a legitimate negative (credit) balance — money the bank owes you — and `apply`/`reverse` round-trip exactly. Updated the surrounding reconcile/`deriveOpeningBalance` comments that referenced the now-removed clamp and its "known limitation".
- `lib/__tests__/ledger.test.ts` — Replaced the "clamps debt payoff transfers at zero" test with "lets a debt payoff transfer overshoot into a credit balance" (200 − 300 → −100) plus a new apply/reverse-inverse test. Added a `reconcileAccountBalance` regression test: a backdated card payment that replays before its charge now reconciles to the true owed balance (0), not the inflated value (1000).
- `lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts` — Updated `applyTransferToBalance` overpayment test (50 − 100 → −50) and replaced the `reverseTransferToBalance` "KNOWN LIMITATION" clamp test with an exact apply/reverse round-trip test.

**Notes:**
- Both the live transaction route and the reconciler go through `nextBalanceForAccount` → `applyTransferToBalance`, so live balances and reconcile stay consistent; live credit-card payoffs that overpay can now show a negative (credit) balance, which is financially correct.
- Verification: standalone Node repro confirmed clamped reconcile = 1000 vs fixed = 0 for the backdated-payment scenario. `tsc --noEmit` shows no errors in the changed files (the unrelated module-not-found errors are because `node_modules` isn't installed in this environment).
